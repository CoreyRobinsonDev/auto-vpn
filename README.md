## Running without Password
This program is meant to run without intervention in the background. However `openvpn` is ran with `sudo` and `sudo` requires you to enter your user password. <br>
To get around this do the following:

- Edit `/etc/sudoers` with `visudo`
```bash
sudo visudo
```
- Add the following with your username and path to `openvpn`
```bash
[your_username] ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: [/path/to/openvpn]
```
